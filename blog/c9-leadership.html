    <h2> What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h2>

    <p>
      Over the years I think we all have had a mixed bag of both camppasionate leaders. Some of the most memorable one for me have been with mountaineering.
      You have to have a lot trust and lot comradery with a small crew. When things get tough it takes a special type of leader to really encourage and keep everyone calm.
      While knowing we are fully capable of doing what we came there to do even if we have some small doubts.

    <h2> Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it? </h2>

    <p>
      This was another great meditation. It was amazing  feeling goodness welling in myself and giving it to the world.
    </p>

    <h2> Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it? </h2>

    <p>
      This was really similar to the multiplying goodnes meditation. It was really interesting to turn the negative feeling into something positive it was rather empowering.
    </p>

    <h2> Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h2>

    <p>
      I have had lot of practice with this one in the last year. After having my accident it seems like there is a constant need for difficult conversations.
      My body no longer goes into the fight or flight mode. It has improved a lot since I have been thinking more about the intent of the person who is initating the conversation.
      Over all I am pretty confident in this deparment.
