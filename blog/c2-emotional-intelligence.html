  <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

  <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
  <p>
    I learned that Emotional Intelligence can be trained, I had just imagined it was something that you had gained.
    It was interesting that by training your emtional intelligence that it can actually change your brain shape.
    With training you can become more self-aware of yourself and your surrounding and better manage situations.
    By doing this it can have an over all postive effect on your worklife and personal happiness.
    It is amazing how quickly you can notice these changes in yourself with only so little practice.

  <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
  <p>
    It has been really lovely making mindfulness a part of my daily habits.
    Most of the time it goes more that two minutes but if I feel like can't do it just even one mindfull breathe is enough.
