    <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>
    <p>
      I think they are pretty similar things where that go hand in hand with one another.
      Mindfulness is paying attention is a certain way .
      While self awerness is self-reflection wihch is pretty much mindfullness. They are both trainable.
    </p>

    <h2>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h2>
    <p>
    I have been journaling a lot lately and this has been helping with my memory a lot which is really great.
    I thought I wasn't going to like it very much but have gotten into a habit of doing it almost daily now.
    Since the last time I tried to do the body scan didn't turn out so well I haven't really tried it but will give it another go.
     </p>

    <h2>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h2>
    <p>
      I really liked this section while not being a new concept it is an important concept.
       It is great to be able to recognise your emotions and deal with them in a positive and logical manner.
       This teaches you how, from having your emotiongs control you to you feeling/choosing/controlling your emotions.
